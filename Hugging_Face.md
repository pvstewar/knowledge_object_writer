## Key Technologies

Here are some key technologies to focus on in learning how to leverage Huggingface for Data Science:
1. Transformers library: Familiarize yourself with the Transformers library, which provides a unified API for working with various NLP models. The official documentation (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) is an excellent starting point.
2. PyTorch and TensorFlow: Hugging Face's models are built on top of these popular deep learning frameworks. Gain proficiency in at least one of them to effectively utilize Hugging Face's tools. You can find tutorials and resources on their respective websites (https://pytorch.org/ and https://www.tensorflow.org/).
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP) fundamentals: Develop a strong understanding of NLP concepts, such as tokenization, word embeddings, and language models. The "Natural Language Processing with Python" book by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper is a comprehensive resource. [Freely available online here.](https://www.nltk.org/book/)
4. Hugging Face Hub: Explore the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models), a platform for sharing and discovering pre-trained models, datasets, and metrics. Familiarize yourself with the available models and their use cases.

## Terminology
1. Transformer: A type of neural network architecture that has revolutionized NLP by effectively handling long-range dependencies in text data.
2. Pre-trained model: A model that has been trained on a large dataset and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks with minimal additional training.
3. Fine-tuning: The process of adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task by training it on a smaller, task-specific dataset.
4. Tokenization: The process of splitting text into smaller units called tokens, which can be words, subwords, or characters.
5. Embedding: A dense vector representation of a word or token that captures its semantic meaning.
6. Attention mechanism: A technique used in Transformer models that allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input when making predictions.
