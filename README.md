# Knowledge Object Writer

### Writing Informative Articles with Large Language Models

The purpose of this project is to generate useful knowledge objects that will explain concepts and provide references and guidance for people who are interested in learning more about each concept. The idea here is that we will leverage langchain and large language models to generate the basic text so that we can take on the role of editor and refine the generated articles to produce high quality and accurate results at a scale that we would not be able to achieve when creating the knowledge objects from scratch on our own. Using this code will provide a starting point for the author to identify the key concepts and potential sources indicated by the rough draft the LLMs are producing, and creating the finalized Knowledge Object will give the author more experience and understanding of the topic while also creating a useful resource for others to reference.
